## Introduction

Nexus is a League of Legends fan project intended to help players quickly and seamlessly find an optimal champion build, rune page and champion synergies in one simple layout.

## Live features

### Integration with Riot Games API

The website leverages the robust server-side features of Next.js, built on Node.js, to connect with the Riot Games API. This setup enables the dynamic fetching of essential data such as champion images and descriptions.

### Responsive design

The website's responsive design is achieved through the integration of Tailwind CSS, CSS Grid, Flexbox, and JavaScript. Tailwind CSS and CSS Grid handle the structural aspects, while Flexbox ensures fluid content layout. JavaScript complements these technologies by dynamically adjusting elements and interactions, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices.
